          <h1> Greetings Everyone!</h1>
          <p>I am Justin Mc Neal G. Caronongan 
          and currently a student at University of Pangasinan, 
          Dagupan Campus. I am a first year under Bachelor of 
          Science on Information and Technology.

        <p class="why_it">Why Chose IT? <br>
          <span class="statement">I chose IT (Information Technology) because of the fact that I am
            interested in it. I do have the passion to learn and to understand how computers and software work. 
            It is also related to my future career opportunities. Since IT offers a wide range of career opportunities 
            with the potential for job security and growth. The field on computers is constantly evolving.
            IT careers can also be financially rewarding due to its complexibility and a lot of companies today
            give a huge amount of competitive salaries and benefits. Lastly, I chose this course due to the fact that
            most of the IT professional are flexible in terms of remote work and flexible hours, which is really attracting.
